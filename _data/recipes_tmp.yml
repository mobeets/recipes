    comment: "one week after bottling. definitely under-carbonated, but enough to have a solid head when poured into a glass, and definitely drinkable! it tasted like beer. very mild, which is surprising given how bitter it was the day we brewed it. still had some bitterness, but no overwhelming hop aromas really. kinda tasted like honey (even though we used table sugar?) so I think I'm gonna buy some dextrose. also it tasted a little bit like apple juice, which apparently either means a) we need to wait longer before we drink it, or b) we fermented at too high of a temperature. a seems unlikely only because we let it ferment for two weeks, even if it's only been a week since we bottled. but i dunno. either way, it wasn't bad at all! and actually alcoholic. pretty magical."

    comment: "two weeks after bottling, and apple taste is entirely gone! also...so is the flavor? but it's fine! near the end of the bottle it kinda reminds me of what I remember melbourne bitter being like: no aroma, no real flavor, just a sort of vaguely bitter beer taste. it's light in flavor, for sure. as for the carbonation, if anything it's maybe over-carbed? lots of foam inside the bottle as we're drinking it--or does that always happen?"

    comment: "one week after bottling citra. it tastes incredible! I knew it was good before I even took a sip: a great aroma. It tastes delicious, beats the first cascade one by a mile. it's ALL about the dry hopping--I am so glad we dry hopped this one. To my lazy palate, this beer was already in the realm of \"it tastes like an IPA, therefore I love it\". Jess has named it \"Mr. Marris,\" by \"Slug Brothers Brewing\" (which we'd already chosen as our name)"

    comment: "couldn't get the siphon working for the life of us. need a better method, big time. like a pump. it took us like an hour total, and there was beer everywhere (floor, arms, counters, etc.) at the end. but we made 9 bottles! and afterwards, just thinking about it, it felt great. for sugar, ended up doing 1oz white sugar in 1/4c water, boiled for a minute or two and then cooled to room temp (didn't take long). temperature calculator: https://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-priming-calculator/"

    comment: "7 days prior, I dry hopped citra by dropping it right into the fermenter. Sadly I didn't write down the amount, but I'm guessing I did about 6g. 3 days prior, I put it in the fridge to cold crash. priming sugar: 0.9oz, 1/4 cup water, left it liquidy enough so i wasn't worried about it being syrupy. only ended up with 8 full bottles (dry hopping meant less liquid to siphon because of the hops in the bottom?), and one broken bottle with half a bottle of beer everywhere. we made a total mess again, so maybe try in the laundry room next time? to get the siphon going, we tilted the pot, which seemed to help. and it's possible that getting the flow started with a shorter tube would be easier? need to compare. next time: do a COMPLETE simulation of the process using water, the stock pot, and bottles. also, long tube was maybe too long--the closer thing wouldn't stop the flow entirely."

  - date: "9/7/20"
    comment: "same as last time but with citra (with amounts adjusted for by the alpha). realized later that this have been pale ales, not an ipa. anyway, much easier this time. 3.5 hours start to finish including cleanup. used the big 8 quart stock pot with 6 quarts of water and that worked perfectly. stored it in the instant pot to insulate during the hour long heat off part with the malt. then kept it at a super low boil (like at 5-6 on the burner) the whole time. i wish i had non-iodine sanitizer just because it kinda freaks me out. also, a bag of ice helped SO much. cooled to 70F within 20 minutes! stirring while cooling was CRITICAL and would drop degrees so fast. sanitized digital thermometer clipped on with sanitized clothespin onto stock pot while cooling, which was also convenient. no need for temperature control during the brewing part. also, i used like half tap water, half spring water. hope that doesn't fuck the taste up...we'll see."

That just made the sourdough angry and alcoholic tasting. They were fine, but not as good as last time. But a half-recipe is basically the right amount, by the way."

    comment: "a single 1.8 lb steak, seasoned REAL good. Preheat oven to 450F with cast iron in it. Then I seared it on the grill for about 2 minutes each side, and then put it in the cast iron in the oven with the thermometer probe in it. Baked (for around 18 minutes) until 130F, then let rest for 5 minutes. Served with brussels sprouts and mashed sweet potatoes. Best steak we've ever made by far."

Dried them off with paper towels before seasoning, and put them in the small orange dutch oven. But if there'd been more I might have needed a bigger pot. Anyway, also added four carrots to the sauce in with the meat. Cooked about 2.5 hours exactly and all the juices were mostly gone. One of the best meals we've made. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and sourdough toast."

    comment: "We have it with baked asparagus on the side. We baked the chicken the same as last time. We ended up brining for two hours with the second hour being out of the fridge, and then after drying the chicken with paper towels, just let it sit out for like 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. (The recipe says to dry it for an hour.) It turned out great! Also, to the sauce we added paprika and a squirt of sriracha. Delicious."

  - date: "5/18/15"
    comment: "1.5 times the recipe gave us 5 servings again. don't multiply the oil, though, and infuse the garlic in the oil a la Hazan rather than just dicing it up. also, cook spices in butter and then add chickpeas--add TONS of spices because it's not that flavorful. still add spices to the oil. greek yogurt for sure and not traditional. when you eat, top with brown sugar."
  - date: "2/9/16"
    comment: "Make sure not to burn the almonds! Also, maybe we should be cooking the chickpeas in the spices like in the chickpea curry, and the oil could just be the garlic fried in oil. and add the almonds last, or toast separately so they don't burn"

    comment: "Tonight I made 7 burgers from 1.5 lbs of beef, breaking up the beef into the little strands as much as possible, and then lightly (as lightly as possible) clumping them back together into patties. Seasoning with salt, pepper, and Lawry's salt, and then cooking in the cast iron and flipping once, smashing, and keeping all the lovely grease around. They were delicious, and I ate mine on a so-fresh-they-were-hot Fiesta bolillo with the last beautiful tomato from the garden and a slice of cheddar cheese."

    comment: "should have read the comments and cooked at 350F instead of 400F. I used walnuts, pulsed using the the vitamix. the batter was DELICIOUS and so were the cookies. I used the cookie scooper for making them, and I'd say it made about 32 total (I froze half, so this is just a guess). Super easy to make though."

    comment: "starter had been in the fridge for two days and then spent 18 hours on the counter. It turned out pretty good! Better than the last one: more cooked, a little fluffier--but it still could use some improvement. A little more fluffiness, a little more sour, a little holier of a crumb."
  - date: "5/29/14"
    comment: "best one yet, for sure: The key was a very healthy starter (i.e. tons of bubbles), and the time in the fridge definitely did the same bubbliness to the dough. bread is done at 200F in the center, which is good to know."
  - date: "6/12/14"
    comment: "still improving--amazing sour smell that really gives it away; still bad bottom crust, but the inside this time is perrrrfect. imagine if the oven had consistent temps, too! i understand the folding of the dough now, too, because it makes the bread kinda break away really nicely when you eat it"

    comment: "turned out much better this time! remembered to score it, and to put the temp. probe in when I took the lid off. The pot didn't smoke this time, but the crust did still burn a bit on the outside and I don't know why. Much tastier than the one from two days ago though, I think because the starter was more mature for this one. Also, the dough was _super_ wet last night so I added a bit more flour, but still super wet, but still turned out totally fine in the end, just was harder to work with"

I think that helpd a lot, because the bread was much spongier this time compared to recent times. Still pretty flat as a whole though. I never have figured out whether that's because it's under- or over-proved."

    comment: "proofed overnight from 7pm-7am. when doing the stretch and folds at that point, it didn't tear. but maybe in retrospect given how flat the loaf was, it was over-proofed. 68F in here. preheated about 30 mins instead of an hour. 25 mins at 500F, but needed 21 mins at 450F (to get to 208F). not very risen, and a little light in color. also forgot to score it."

    comment: "nailed it, FINALLY! (i forgot that stretch-and-fold happens right after you make the dough, so i skipped that this time.) i let the bulk ferment go from like 6pm-9am, because it just wasn't looking risen enough, and I suspect from reading online that _under_-proving has been our problem. then i shaped it, let it sit for about 1.5 hours, then baked 500F for 30mins, 450F for 15mins or so. i think for knowing when it's proved enough, what we really need is a clear bowl so we can mark/see when it's doubled in size more easily."
