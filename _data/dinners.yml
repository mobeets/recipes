Mel's kitchen dough (single serving) makes enough for one pie on the large silver tray; we use 1c of hazan's tomato sauce (one recipe makes ~3c), about 2c of three-cheese mexican shredded cheese, about 6oz mushrooms (sliced, placed both under and on top of cheese), a bit more than 1/2lb of bacon (6 strips of 11, where 11 was 1/2lb), and listen to yourself about how much cheese and not to Jess; we cook it right on the tray, 475F, lower oven, after pre-heating the big tray. it did stick just a little bit--we forgot to add some flour. we use 3oz prosciutto, 6oz mushrooms, and for cheese, some garlic chevre and mozzarella (both from Aldi). turned out delicious!"

  comments: "see last notes; Make sure not to burn the almonds! Also, maybe we should be cooking the chickpeas in the spices like in the chickpea curry, and the oil could just be the garlic fried in oil. and add the almonds last, or toast separately so they don't burn; 1.5 times the recipe gave us 5 servings again. don't multiply the oil, though, and infuse the garlic in the oil a la Hazan rather than just dicing it up. also, cook spices in butter and then add chickpeas--add TONS of spices because it's not that flavorful. still add spices to the oil. greek yogurt for sure and not traditional. when you eat, top with brown sugar.; pretty good! added a bit more tahini than suggested, I think; also, probably needs more spices; and a thicker yogurt, too. and don't forget to flip the pita bread triangles in the oven! made 5 servings"

  comments: "we make a double recipe, and it's a good amount; this time with bucatini, but Jess, please don't cook the whole pound of pasta...Though we should definitely make double the sauce next time; we cook 10oz. bacon (from bacon butt bits), add a diced medium onion, then a full large can of whole plum tomatoes (no oil, no butter), and then chili flakes; delicious!"
