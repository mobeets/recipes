Dried them off with paper towels before seasoning, and put them in the small orange dutch oven. But if there'd been more I might have needed a bigger pot. Anyway, also added four carrots to the sauce in with the meat. Cooked about 2.5 hours exactly and all the juices were mostly gone. One of the best meals we've made. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and sourdough toast."

  - date: "1/16/18"
    comment: "we used two onions, and 6x the broth, just skipping the sake because we had none. we made the chicken cutlets using thin breasts and flour, egg, panko. this recipe takes a bit if you make the cutlets and the broth, mostly just because of the cutlets. we cooked the onions for quite a while, maybe 15 minutes. for the dashi, we used one packet with 3 cups of water, and boiled it along with the sugar and other liquids like mirin. it turned out so delicious..."
  - date: "5/22/18"
    comment: "to confirm the last note, we did 3x the broth (not 6x). for chicken, we did a dry salt brine (1/4c salt + 1t baking powder on 1.5 lbs thin breasts) for 2 hours, and rinsed off salt afterward, and still _plenty_ salty"

    comment: "We have it with baked asparagus on the side. We baked the chicken the same as last time. We ended up brining for two hours with the second hour being out of the fridge, and then after drying the chicken with paper towels, just let it sit out for like 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. (The recipe says to dry it for an hour.) It turned out great! Also, to the sauce we added paprika and a squirt of sriracha. Delicious."

    comment: "1.5 times the recipe gave us 5 servings again. don't multiply the oil, though, and infuse the garlic in the oil a la Hazan rather than just dicing it up. also, cook spices in butter and then add chickpeas--add TONS of spices because it's not that flavorful. still add spices to the oil. greek yogurt for sure and not traditional. when you eat, top with brown sugar."

    comment: "instructions from last time were vague, so to be clear: double the beef (2 lbs), add some mushrooms and an onion, and use a jar (25 oz) of pasta sauce and also another cup or so of pasta sauce that we had lying around. also 15oz ricotta and 10oz mozzarrella. 8 lasagna noodle strips total. turned out great."

    comment: "Tonight I made 7 burgers from 1.5 lbs of beef, breaking up the beef into the little strands as much as possible, and then lightly (as lightly as possible) clumping them back together into patties. Seasoning with salt, pepper, and Lawry's salt, and then cooking in the cast iron and flipping once, smashing, and keeping all the lovely grease around. They were delicious, and I ate mine on a so-fresh-they-were-hot Fiesta bolillo with the last beautiful tomato from the garden and a slice of cheddar cheese."

    comment: "very unique but delicious! i use 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar. i brown the butter for both the blondie and the icing. no extra salt since it's in the butter. and 1t cinnamon. for the frosting, only 1/2 powdered sugar, and 1/4c brown sugar. also no foil in the baking dish."

  - date: "6/13/20"
    comment: "for the icing, I think by 3T baking chocolate I must have meant 3 oz? Today I did 2 oz and it was a little short in terms of icing, but still fine."

That just made the sourdough angry and alcoholic tasting. They were fine, but not as good as last time. But a half-recipe is basically the right amount, by the way."

    comment: "starter had been in the fridge for two days and then spent 18 hours on the counter. It turned out pretty good! Better than the last one: more cooked, a little fluffier--but it still could use some improvement. A little more fluffiness, a little more sour, a little holier of a crumb."
  - date: "5/29/14"
    comment: "best one yet, for sure: The key was a very healthy starter (i.e. tons of bubbles), and the time in the fridge definitely did the same bubbliness to the dough. bread is done at 200F in the center, which is good to know."
  - date: "6/12/14"
    comment: "still improving--amazing sour smell that really gives it away; still bad bottom crust, but the inside this time is perrrrfect. imagine if the oven had consistent temps, too! i understand the folding of the dough now, too, because it makes the bread kinda break away really nicely when you eat it"

    comment: "turned out much better this time! remembered to score it, and to put the temp. probe in when I took the lid off. The pot didn't smoke this time, but the crust did still burn a bit on the outside and I don't know why. Much tastier than the one from two days ago though, I think because the starter was more mature for this one. Also, the dough was _super_ wet last night so I added a bit more flour, but still super wet, but still turned out totally fine in the end, just was harder to work with"
