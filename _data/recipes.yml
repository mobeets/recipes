  - "to confirm the last note, we did 3x the broth (not 6x). for chicken, we did a dry salt brine (1/4c salt + 1t baking poweder on 1.5 lbs thin breasts) for 2 hours, and rinsed off salt afterward, and still _plenty_ salty"

We ended up brining for two hours with the second hour being out of the fridge, and then after drying the chicken with paper towels, just let it sit out for like 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. (The recipe says to dry it for an hour.) It turned out great! Also, to the sauce we added paprika and a squirt of sriracha. Delicious."

  - "Make sure not to burn the almonds! Also, maybe we should be cooking the chickpeas in the spices like in the chickpea curry, and the oil could just be the garlic fried in oil. and add the almonds last, or toast separately so they don't burn"

  - "Tonight I made 7 burgers from 1.5 lbs of beef, breaking up the beef into the little strands as much as possible, and then lightly (as lightly as possible) clumping them back together into patties. Seasoning with salt, pepper, and Lawry's salt, and then cooking in the cast iron and flipping once, smashing, and keeping all the lovely grease around. They were delicious, and I ate mine on a so-fresh-they-were-hot Fiesta bolillo with the last beautiful tomato from the garden and a slice of cheddar cheese."

  - "definitely double both"
  - "Jess does it alone"
  - "double everything but maybe not the lemon; also, use less soy sauce in the walnuts (too salty!); also, maybe use pecans and not walnuts since they tend to be a bit cheaper"
  - "used pecans instead of walnuts; Jess says do 1.5 times soy sauce instead of 2 times"
  - "Made with half almonds, half pecans. Defrost nuts first or else the almonds never quite blended. Or blend the pecans and almonds in separate batches, either way."
