    p.s., I've been snooping through your files, and I found a few changes to your data this week:
    <ul>
    <li>Found 1 new meals in lifelog: grilled cheese and tomato soup</li>
    <li>Updates from lifelog:</li>
    <li>New comment in "fried chicken sandwiches": "1/2/22 | Turned out great! We did half the cayenne, and I still think it was a bit too much? Not that it was spicy, it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for. Or maybe it was all the paprika. But still, super delicious. #foodlab"</li>
    </ul>
    To commit these changes, run the following:
    <pre>
cd ~/code/recipes<br>cp /Users/mobeets/code/recipes/_data/recipes_tmp.yml _data/recipes.yml<br>git add .<br>git commit -m "data update"<br>git push<br>
    </pre>
