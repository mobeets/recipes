    <li>New comment in "white bean soup with bacon": "1/1/22 | basically the ham hock bean soup but with bacon. Best part is adding parmesan rind for the broth -- that's ESSENTIAL.

    <li>New comment in "chicken pot pie": "1/5/21 | New recipe. +2T flour to thicken it up faster. Only used top pie crust layer (didn't do bottom) -- used store bought Pillsbury dough.

    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "10/8/23 | with frozen pie dough in shell | https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23439/perfect-pumpkin-pie/"</li>

Made with side of roasted sweet potatoes with a Tahini sauce (Tahini, water, lemon juice, salt) and Tsaziki. | https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-falafel/#wprm-recipe-container-35557"</li>
