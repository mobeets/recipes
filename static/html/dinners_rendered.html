    <ul>
    <li>Updates from lifelog (jay):</li>
    <li>Found 3 new meal(s) in lifelog: chocolate chip muffins, fast pizza dough, applesauce muffins</li>
    <li>New comment in "hazan's bolognese": "1/11/25 | this is THE bolognese to make, with some mods because the proportions are a bit different than what we have on hand: 1 lb ground beef, 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes, + 1-2 tbs of tomato paste, + lt 1tbs parsley, + lt 1tbs basil, + 1-2 tsp sage #popular"</li>
    <li>New comment in "cast iron pizza": "1/4/25 | jess says she doubled it, and for the flour she did did 550 (275*2) | https://sugarspunrun.com/the-best-pizza-dough-recipe/comment-page-273/"</li>
    <li>New comment in "creamy tortellini soup": "1/7/25 | added the parmesan rind for dinner with leigh & zach, they enjoyed it #popular | https://damndelicious.net/2019/01/30/creamy-tortellini-soup/"</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/11/13 | "</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/25/20 | I don't do the pecans, and sub 5oz evaporated milk in place of cream. Cooks for about 55 minutes, and smells delicious. Keebler graham cracker crust. | https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pecan-rye-pumpkin-pie"</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/23/23 | "</li>
    <li>New tag in "pumpkin pie": "dessert"</li>
    <li>New comment in "beef fajitas": "1/17/25 | "</li>
    <li>New comment in "banana muffins": "1/1/25 | r&j love these. makes 12 regular muffins. 3/4 cup chocolate chips is sufficient. frozen bananas work, defrost, and drain moisture #breakfast #popular | https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/banana-muffins/"</li>

    <li>Found 7 new meal(s): roasted cauliflower pasta & walnuts, ribeye steak, chicken tortellini soup, whole wheat pancakes, ribeye steak, steamed kale, baked sweet potato, chana masala, tomato glaze meatloaves with brown butter mashed potatoes</li>
    <li>New comment in "white bean soup with bacon": "1/1/22 | basically the ham hock bean soup but with bacon. Best part is adding parmesan rind for the broth -- that's ESSENTIAL.

    <li>New comment in "chicken pot pie": "1/5/21 | New recipe. +2T flour to thicken it up faster. Only used top pie crust layer (didn't do bottom) -- used store bought Pillsbury dough.
