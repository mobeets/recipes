        Hello friends. You must eat food each night this week in a meal some call "dinner." <a href="https://mobeets.github.io/recipes/#year=all&list=all&tag=this-week">Here</a> are this week's options:<br><br>
    
    <table>
    </table>

    <br>Love,<br>William Langeford

    <br><br>
    p.s., I've been snooping through your files, and I found a few changes to your data this week:
    <ul>
    <li>Updates from lifelog (jay):</li>
    <li>Found 1 new meal(s) in lifelog: white bread</li>
    <li>New comment in "steel cut oats": "7/27/25 | used the same ingredients/amounts as usual, but was unsure what the pressure cooker instructions were. i did 3 mins on high, and 10 mins natural release. it was pretty liquidy at the end but i let it air off a bit, and i think it will be okay in the end."</li>
    <li>New comment in "beef stew": "7/29/25 | "</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/11/13 | "</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/25/20 | I don't do the pecans, and sub 5oz evaporated milk in place of cream. Cooks for about 55 minutes, and smells delicious. Keebler graham cracker crust. | https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pecan-rye-pumpkin-pie"</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "11/23/23 | "</li>
    <li>New tag in "pumpkin pie": "dessert"</li>
    <li>New comment in "brownies": "7/27/25 | perfect. added about 1/2c of choc chips. cooked a little slow, 27 mins or so. | http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/best-cocoa-brownies/"</li>
    <li>Updates from yaml (jess):</li>

    <li>New tag in "banana muffins": "popular"</li>
    <li>New comment in "white bean soup with bacon": "1/1/22 | basically the ham hock bean soup but with bacon. Best part is adding parmesan rind for the broth -- that's ESSENTIAL. I think could easily just add a hunk of parm (if you don't have just the rind). | https://themodernproper.com/white-bean-soup-with-bacon"</li>
    <li>New comment in "chicken pot pie": "1/5/21 | New recipe. +2T flour to thicken it up faster. Only used top pie crust layer (didn't do bottom) -- used store bought Pillsbury dough. Didn't have celery and it was totally fine. | https://www.thewholesomedish.com/the-best-classic-chicken-pot-pie/#recipe"</li>
    <li>New comment in "pumpkin pie": "10/8/23 | with frozen pie dough in shell | https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23439/perfect-pumpkin-pie/"</li>
    <li>New tag in "pumpkin pie": "dinner"</li>
    <li>New comment in "falafel": "6/5/22 | Really tasty. Doubled it and it made ~ 16 falafel. Enough for Jay and I for two nights. I added 1+ T flour, 1 egg, and panko. Made with side of roasted sweet potatoes with a Tahini sauce (Tahini, water, lemon juice, salt) and Tsaziki. | https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-falafel/#wprm-recipe-container-35557"</li>
