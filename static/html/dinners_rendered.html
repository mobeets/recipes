        Hello friends. You must eat food each night this week in a meal some call "dinner." <a href="https://mobeets.github.io/recipes/#year=all&list=all&tag=this-week">Here</a> are this week's options:<br><br>
    
    <table>
    </table>

    <br>Love,<br>William Langeford

    <br><br>
    p.s., I've been snooping through your files, and I found a few changes to your data this week:
    <ul>
    <li>Updates from lifelog (jay):</li>
    <li>New comment in "poached egg with hollandaise": "1/22/22 | 5 minutes overcooked the poached eggs, big time. but the fine strainer (the cocktail one) worked pretty good, for the first egg anyway. for the hollandaise, I used one egg yolk, about 1-2T of butter, and a sliver's worth of lemon juice. Should've really made sure the butter was up to 180F like Kenji's recipe said before putting in the food processor."</li>
    <li>New tag in "poached egg with hollandaise": "foodlab"</li>
    <li>New comment in "red lentil curry": "10/19/21 | "</li>
    <li>New comment in "red lentil curry": "12/19/23 | Jess says drain the lentils before adding them. Use diced tomatoes. And add fat from coconut milk as needed. (Also she says ignore the earlier note about _not_ adding coconut milk.)"</li>
    <li>New tag in "red lentil curry": "staple"</li>
    <li>New comment in "hazan's pasta carbonara": "10/23/21 | "</li>

    <li>New comment in "burrito bowl": "5/9/19 | jess says for beans and peppers: caramelize 2 onions, then add 2 bell peppers, then add 2 cans of pinto beans, 2-3 garlic cloves, chili powder, tiny bit of cumin, and oregano, salt and pepper. then remove them and add in 3 chicken breasts (1.5 lbs.) cubed and seasoned with lawry's, salt, pepper, chili powder, and cook in butter."</li>

    <li>New comment in "fried chicken sandwiches": "1/2/22 | Turned out great! We did half the cayenne, and I still think it was a bit too much? Not that it was spicy, it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for. Or maybe it was all the paprika. But still, super delicious. 1.5 lbs made 8 chickens. | https://www.seriouseats.com/five-ingredient-fried-chicken-sandwich-recipe"</li>

    <li>New comment in "hazan's bolognese": "2/23/20 | delicious. I double recipe (with 1.5 lbs ground beef, and 1 of the big cans of plum tomatoes), but it only looks like about 6 servings."</li>
    <li>New comment in "hazan's bolognese": "1/11/25 | this is THE bolognese to make, with some mods because the proportions are a bit different than what we have on hand: 1 lb ground beef, 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes, + 1-2 tbs of tomato paste, + lt 1tbs parsley, + lt 1tbs basil, + 1-2 tsp sage"</li>

    <li>New comment in "grilled cheese and tomato soup": "1/1/22 | Made for lunch using kenji's recipe. The soup was pretty good--way better than a can for sure. The sandwich wasn't worth the extra work I don't think, but the parmesan added to the outside and grilled again was a nice touch actually."</li>
    <li>New tag in "grilled cheese and tomato soup": "foodlab"</li>
    <li>New comment in "kenji's weeknight chili": "1/16/22 | Prepped as many things as possible beforehand, which was critical. It was a lot of prep, but in the end I did all the cooking (including some cornbread on the side) within 30 minutes. It turned out great!"</li>

    <li>New comment in "white bean soup with bacon": "1/1/22 | basically the ham hock bean soup but with bacon. Best part is adding parmesan rind for the broth -- that's ESSENTIAL. I think could easily just add a hunk of parm (if you don't have just the rind). | https://themodernproper.com/white-bean-soup-with-bacon"</li>
    <li>New comment in "chicken pot pie": "1/5/21 | New recipe. +2T flour to thicken it up faster. Only used top pie crust layer (didn't do bottom) -- used store bought Pillsbury dough.
