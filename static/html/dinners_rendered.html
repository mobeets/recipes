    <li>New comment in "chocolate chip cookies": "12/17/22 | chocolate chip blind taste-testing between hershey's special dark, tollhouse 53%, and ghiradelli 60%. in the blind test, I liked the hershey's most, tollhouse least. jess liked the tollhouse most, hershey's least. ghiradelli was a solid 2nd for both of us, but overall the less sweetness kinda meant the chocolate didn't stand out as much"</li>

    <li>New comment in "chicken pot pie": "1/5/21 | New recipe. +2T flour to thicken it up faster. Only used top pie crust layer (didn't do bottom) -- used store bought Pillsbury dough.
